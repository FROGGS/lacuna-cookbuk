=head1 NAME LacunaCookbuk

Client.pm aka client.pl is main client for LacunaCookbuk

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Script helps L<B<https://us1.lacunaexpanse.com/>> players doing boring tasks like moving glyphs to one place that can make plans from them or searching where excess fighters can be put. The intention was putting perl6 into life. 

I use parrot backend for building this. 

All planets must have Trade Ministry, Intelligence Ministry and Archaeology Ministry. All space stations must have Parliament.

Compilation:

	$ panda install JSON::RPC
	$ panda install ufo
	$ panda install Form 

	$ git clone https://github.com/teodozjan/lacuna-cookbuk.git
	$ cd lacuna-cookbuk
	$ cp lib/LacunaCookbuk/SampleConfig.pm lib/LacunaCookbuk/Config.pm 
	$ editor lib/LacunaCookbuk/Config.pm 

	$ ufo
	$ make install

Fun with client:

    $ perl6 bin/client.pl --taks=all


Things that seem to work:

- Caching planets and its buildings
- Finding out what ores are on planets
- Checking whether space port or intelligence ministries are full
- Moving glyphs and plans between planets
- Assembling halls
- Upgrading rules
- Find ineffective ships to replace
- Automatic voting in parliament
- List incoming ships
- Delete Parliament messages automatically 

=head1 TODO Functions

- Normal log in in /etc or var
- Specify different upgrade order for different planets
- Autobalance supply chains (send to home planet)
- Autobalance home planet (if all supply chains will become 0 it won't go negative on happiness)

=head1 TODO Code smell

- Remove logic from Model classess
- Don't give bodybuilder everyone
- Change loops to list generic functions where possible
- Due to perl6 compilation has no spec yet and diffrenet parrot backends treat differently INIT {} blocks it is not safe to declare class attributes that do time or disk consuming operations
