Script helps [lacunaexpanse.com](https://us1.lacunaexpanse.com/) players doing boring tasks like moving glyphs to one place that can make plans from them. 

I use parrot backend for building this. 

All planets must have Trade Ministry, Intelligence Ministry and Archaeology Ministry. All space stations must have Parliament.

Compilation:
```
$ panda install JSON::RPC

$ cd lacuna-cookbuk
$ cp lib/LacunaCookbuk/SampleConfig.pm lib/LacunaCookbuk/Config.pm 
$ editor ib/LacunaCookbuk/Config.pm 

$ ufo

```
